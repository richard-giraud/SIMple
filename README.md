# SIMple

This is a simulation of people going about the wonderful (and sometimes weird) lives.  I hope you enjoy!

## Getting Started

You need the following software installed to run SIMple:

* Linux (Ubuntu or other Debian-based distribution recommended but not required.)
* [BASH](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/)
* [SWI Prolog](https://www.swi-prolog.org/)
* [Logtalk](https://logtalk.org/)

### Install on Ubuntu (or Debian, Mint, etc.)

It's assumed that you have BASH already, so this will install:

* SWI Prolog from the distribution packages
* Logtalk from the dist folder of this repository.

```bash
sudo bin/install-deb
```

### Install on other distributions

You are on your own.  Check out the `bin/install-deb` folder and use its contents to guide you.

## Starting SIMple

Run the following:

```bash
bin/start
```
